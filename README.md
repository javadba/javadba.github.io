Repository for work with a Data visualization course. Contains code deployed onto Vega-Lite and  Tableau

1. Start  an http server - possibly in this same (git repo root) directory
     e.g. `python3 -m http.server 9000`
2.  Point browser at http://localhost:9000/crMain.html
3.  Do NOT contact me to do any javascript for YOU. This was a one time affair ;)
